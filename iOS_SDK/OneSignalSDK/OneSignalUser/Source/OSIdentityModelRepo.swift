 This class stores all Identity Models that are being used during an app session.
 Its purpose is to manage the instances for all referencing objects.
 The models are built up on each new cold start, so no caching occurs.
 
 When are Identity Models added to this repo?
 1. When the User Manager starts, and the Identity Model is loaded from cache.
 2. When users switch and new Identity Models are created.
 3. Identity Models are added when requests are uncached.
