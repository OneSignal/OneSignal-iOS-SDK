/*
 _XCTPrimitive* functions are used here as we need to pass the current XCTestCase being run.
 This has a side effect of Xcode pointing to lines in this file instead of the unit test itself
    if the assert fails.
    - We could also make helpers for each _XCTPrimitive* to make them shorter with less params.
 2nd option woud be to defined with a perprocessor so we can use normal XCTAssert*'s.
   However this has draw backs;
      1. No syntax highlighting
      2. Must end each line with a '/' to support multiline
      3. Can't define input types, they are oddly just inferred.
      4. Possibly others.
 Example of a #define that could be used if we find it is a better fit:
     #define AssertOnFocusAtIndex(index) \
        let request = [OneSignalClientOverrider.executedRequests objectAtIndex:index]; \
        XCTAssertFalse([request isKindOfClass:OSRequestOnFocus.self], @"");
 3rd options is using recordFailureWithDescription noted here:
      - https://www.objc.io/issues/15-testing/xctest/
   It looks like it could be even cleaner with Swift
